Adventure-Game
==============

Group project for Nashville Software School. The class was given overall guidelines for how a 2-dimensional HTML gameboard should perform, and then broken into teams to each implement their own version of the game.

This project demonstrates:
* ability of group members to work in a group and make a successful and complete project
* used of Node.js and Express
* using AJAX and Mongo's non-relational database to keep track of gameboard pieces (and location of
items hidden from the user) and gameboard state.
* creating and removing DOM elements using jQuery
* making a single-page HTML game with animations and CSS3 effects
